🎯 Project Journal – IPL Insights (2008–2025)

A complete Power BI project decoding IPL data season-by-season — built from scratch with advanced DAX, dynamic visuals, and intuitive storytelling.

📅 Day 1 – Data Collection & Modeling
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📁 Folder: /data_sources

✔️ Collected and organized raw datasets:
   - matches.csv
   - deliveries.csv
   - players_data.csv
   - teams_data.csv

✔️ Cleaned data:
   - Fixed nulls and standardised naming.
   - Verified key relationships.

✔️ Imported into Power BI:
   - Established model with correct relationships between matches, teams, deliveries, and players.

✔️ Configured Season slicer across visuals for dynamic filtering.

🧠 Notes:
   - Handled team1/team2/winner logic via USERELATIONSHIP.
   - Created a star schema model.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📅 Day 2 – Season Overview Panel
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📁 Folder: /dax_measures

✔️ Created visuals:
   - Season Winner 🏆
   - Runner-Up 🥈
   - Added dynamic team logos using relationships.

✔️ Measures implemented:
   - `SeasonWinner`
   - `SeasonRunnerUp`

✔️ Slicer connected to all visuals to filter per season.

💡 Idea:
   - Final match determined using `match_number = "Final"`.
